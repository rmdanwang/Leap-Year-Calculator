# Leap-Year-Calculator

A program that asks the user for an integer representing a year. Only a year on or after 1582 must be allowed â€“ this is the year that the Gregorian calendar was adopted. Any year less than this should result in an error message followed by asking the user to re-enter a more appropriate value.
